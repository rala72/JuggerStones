# JuggerStones+
This is a simple Android app to count especially stones and points for Jugger.

## Original App
The _original_ app is developed by Cristian Ca√±adas Vacas.<br>
Here is a PlayStore [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=contador.piedras.jugger).

## Differences
I made some **changes** and **fixes** to the _original_ app.<br>
Here is a list of some changes:
- stones are 0 on app launch _(caused crashes if you didn't press stop before starting)_
- infinity is infinity _(stopped after 9999 stones)_
- team names have default values _(was empty before)_
- team colors are changeable _(new feature!)_
- ...
